# GNOMAN iOS build folder

This folder is prepared for iOS shipping via Capacitor + Xcode.

## What is included
- `ios/` native workspace generated by Capacitor (`npx @capacitor/cli add ios`)
- `scripts/build-ios.sh` for archive + IPA export
- `ios/ExportOptions.plist` for App Store export defaults

## One-time setup (macOS)
1. Install Xcode + Command Line Tools.
2. From repo root:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run ios:add`

## Daily iOS build
1. Build/sync web assets:
   - `npm run ios:sync`
2. Open in Xcode:
   - `npm run ios:open`
3. Configure signing (Team, Bundle ID, Provisioning).
4. Archive/export IPA:
   - `npm run ios:archive`

## API target
The iOS app loads the renderer bundle and calls your backend endpoint configured by GNOMAN settings/environment.

## Ready-to-ship checklist
- [ ] App icon + launch screen configured in Xcode
- [ ] Production backend URL configured
- [ ] Signing profile is valid
- [ ] Archive succeeds for `generic/platform=iOS`
- [ ] Exported IPA installs and launches
